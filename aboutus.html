		<div id="ben"> <img src="ben.jpg" class="image2" >
		<p>My name is Ben Gaspar and I am majoring in Informatics with a cognate in telecommunications. I have a
			minor in telecommunications applications as well. My main role in the team is lead designer. I was in 
			charge of the design planning through use of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and along with application 
			development websites to prepare prototypes and logos. Through user testing of the prototypes, we 
			came to a conclusion of a final design that was most functional and ideal for our clients.
		</p></div>
		<div id="ben"> <img src="dan.jpg" class="image3" >
		<p>I am Daniel Choe, and I am currently a Senior in the School of Informatics with my focus being towards
			business, as well as my minors. In the team, I am a developer, as well as the coordinator and client handler
			for Stephen Volan, Bloomington's head parking administrator. Development was heavily based off use cases and
			client information as well. I helped incorporate Javascript and HTML markup with our other developer, Mark, to get the 
			map and website modelled for specific changes in the design after analysis of the users' responses. Overall, I helped
			create the functionality of the website, as well as helping to maintain communication with the team and client.

		<div id="ben"> <img src="adam.png" class="image2" >
		<p>I am Adam Mandel, a senior informatics major at Indiana University with minors in Business and Marketing. 
		After graduation I will be attending law school at Arizona State University. I worked on the research and 
		design of BTown Parking, as well as assisted in data gathering and the implementation of its database. I was 
		also in charge of user testing, and communicated with the testers to improve the websites functionality and design.
		By gathering data from our users, we were able to effectively resolve small and big issues as a team from the feedback.

		<div id="ben"> <img src="mark.jpg" class="image2" >
		<p> My name is Mark Mongirdas and I am a Senior at Indiana University.  I am majoring in Informatics with a cognate in business.
		My role in the team has been lead developer for BTown Parking.  I wrote the Javascript, PHP, and SQL files and incorporated them into the HTML layout
		of the website.  Some of the biggest challenges were writing the code and getting everything to communicate properly with the server
		on the backend.  Overall I am satisfied with the final product and think that my team members and I accomplished everything we set 
		out to do.</p>
